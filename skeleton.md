 What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?

  
  When I resize the screen to less than 550 px, the layout of the site will reduce around half the size.  If the web site isn't responsive it will show only half of the page, so I might not see the full contents of the page. 

  However, Media queries helps to solve the problem.
  Media query is a CSS technique that enables webpage content to adapt to differnt screen sizes and resolutions.
